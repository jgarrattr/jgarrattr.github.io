short-description: Bloc Chat allows for easy group communication!

---
In a world plagued with so many group chats that you are forced to mute notifications on ninety percent of them, Bloc Chat aims to give you that AIM user experience and allow a seperate web application so you're not forced to see that notification number pile up as your friends send you countless vaguely related articles that you actually don't care about. 

One of the projects presented at Bloc is a web application that demonstrates the ability for other users to interact with your application. Creating a chat room messaging service that is updated automatically to a seperate database is a well rounded and practical project that forced me to think not only how can I set up this project so that it works, but also so that it can have additional rooms and users added on to it at any time without any additional coding.

The main thing I learned from designing my version of Bloc Chat was the importance of foresight in structuring my code so that I can easily use it again as well as the extreme usefulness of having an external database to link your code to and be able to manually edit, add or delete entries.

Overall I felt Bloc Chat definitely brought to life a lot many different small details I have been learning about that seemed to not entirely make sense why certain things were formatted certain ways such as angular services and dependancies. Forcing myself to actually understand why I could not link my rooms from the database and the application only to figure out I didn't actually have the rooms in the place I was calling upon them from made me learn the importance of going back and making sure that my code makes sense and that I am calling upon the correct items in the correct location.
